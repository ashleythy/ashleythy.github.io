### About me

Hi! 

My name is Ashley and I am a self-taught programmer who is currently working as a Data Analyst in a Malaysian start-up.

My interests have seen me pivot from an academic and career backdrop in biomedical and social sciences to the world of data. 

Picking up Python was challenging, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of Stack Overflow, Coursera, DataCamp, and the like.

I aspire to one day work in the intersection of big data and global health. As such, this site was born to document my progress in coding with Python, learning statistics and understanding what machine learning is all about.
