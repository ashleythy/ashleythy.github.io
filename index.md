### About me

Hi! My name is Ashley and I am currently working as a data analyst in a property tech start up in Malaysia.

My academic background however lies within the biomedical and social sciences - specifically, neuroscience and global health and development.

My first programming language was R, back in 2018 when I worked as a public health research assistant. Picking up R from scratch was tough, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of stackoverflow and through online courses on coursera, datacamp, and the like.

Since then, I got increasingly keen in learning programming languages such as R (and now python) to handle big data. It appeals to my interests in solving problems logically and in gleaning real world insights from vast amounts of data.

All these have then culminated in a mini career change, which have seen me jump from working in a predominantly academic heavy environment to landing a data analyst role where my day to day responsibilities involve cleaning (a lot of cleaning!), analysing and interpreting big data.

I one day aspire to work in the intersection of data and global health. As such, this site was born to serve as an online platform for me to document my progress in this regard!

### Portfolio

There is no particular order to my explorations of the rather arbitrary subject matters as below. I wish to ultimately collate a list of milestones where every subsequent post would be progressively better than the ones before.
