### ABOUT ME

Hi, my name is Ashley and I am a Data Scientist who pivoted from a career in Public Health research and consulting. 

I am a self-taught Python programmer so all thanks go to Udacity, StatQuest with Josh Starmer, Statistics by Jim, Joma Tech, and many more, for patiently teaching me the ropes. 

I typically learn best by doing, so this site was conceived to document my learnings, however big or small.
