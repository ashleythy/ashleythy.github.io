### About me

Hi! My name is Ashley and I am currently working as a data analyst in a property tech start up in Malaysia.

My academic background however lies within the biomedical and social sciences, specifically, neuroscience and global health and development.

My first programming language was R, back in 2018 when I worked as a public health research assistant. Picking up R from scratch was tough, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of stack overflow and through online courses on coursera, datacamp, and the like. The same applies to my relationship with Python. 

I one day aspire to work in the intersection of big data and global health. As such, this site was born to serve as an online platform for me to document my progress in this regard!
