### About me

Hi! My name is Ashley and I am currently working as a data analyst in a property tech start up in Malaysia.

My academic background, however, lies within the biomedical and social sciences, specifically in neuroscience and global health and development.

My first programming language was R, back in 2018 when I worked as a public health research assistant. Picking up R from scratch was tough, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of stack overflow and through online courses on coursera, datacamp, and the like. The same applies to my relationship with Python. 

I aspire to one day work in the intersection of big data and global health. As such, this site was born for me to document my progress in this regard!

### Portfolio

The goal is to collate a list of milestones where every subsequent post would be progressively better than the ones before:

6) [Predicting movie ratings on IMDb](/html/entry6.html), <i>29 Oct 2019</i>

In my third exercise, I use linear and multiple regression modelling to understand factors affecting movie ratings on IMDb. 

5) [Statistical inference with the GSS data](/html/entry5.html), <i>15 Oct 2019</i>

In my second exercise of the Coursera course, I explore another dataset. Here, in addition to a mere descriptive analysis of the data, I also put into pratice what I have learnt about conducting statistical tests, such as the Chi-squared test. 

4) [Exploring the BRFSS dataset with descriptive analysis](/html/entry4.html), <i>29 August 2019</i>

I started taking online lessons on Coursera in relation to [statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics), which required me to execute several peer-reviewed exercises. I will be documenting my homework here. In this first exercise, I explore a dataset with simple visualisation methods and summary statistics for descriptive purposes. 

3) [Cleaning data using stringr](/html/entry3.html), <i>01 July 2019</i>

My novice introduction to the term 'data wrangling' and 'regex', and the concept of defining functions to avoid repeating similar tasks when scripting. 

2) [Quantifying the relationship between global carbon dioxide emission and economic growth](/html/entry2.html), <i>20 Jan 2019</i>

Here, I calculate the strength of relationship between the above variables using Pearson's correlation test. I also put my basic understanding of correlations and p-values to the test. 

1) [Visualising the relationship between global carbon dioxide emission and economic growth](/html/entry1.html), <i>24 Dec 2018</i>

My first very attempt in visualising an in-built dataset by the World Bank using the R plotly package (and R markdown)!
