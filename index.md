## About me

#### Hi! I am Ashley and I am currently working as a data analyst in a property tech start up in Malaysia.

#### My academic background however lies within the biomedical and social sciences - specifically, neuroscience and global health and development.

#### My first programming language was R, back in 2018 when I worked as a public health research assistant. Picking up R from scratch was tough, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of stackoverflow and through online courses on coursera, datacamp, and the like.

#### Since then, I got increasingly keen in learning programming languages such as R (and now python) to handle big data. It appeals to my interests in solving problems logically and in gleaning real world insights from vast amounts of data.

#### All these have then culminated in a mini career change, which have seen me jump from working in a predominantly academic heavy backdrop to landing a data analyst role where my day to day responsibilities involve cleaning (a lot of cleaning!), analysing and interpreting big data.

#### I one day aspire to work in the intersection of data and global health.

#### As such, this site was born to serve as an online platform for me to document my progress in this regard!
