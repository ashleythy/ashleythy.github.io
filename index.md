### About me

Hi! My name is Ashley and I am currently working as a data analyst in a property tech start up in Malaysia.

My academic background, however, lies within the biomedical and social sciences, specifically in neuroscience and global health and development.

My first programming language was R, back in 2018 when I worked as a public health research assistant. Picking up R from scratch was tough, but I couldnâ€™t have done so without the trusty help of fellow data enthusiasts of stack overflow and through online courses on coursera, datacamp, and the like. The same applies to my relationship with Python. 

I aspire to one day work in the intersection of big data and global health. As such, this site was born for me to document my progress in this regard!

### Portfolio

The goal is to collate a list of milestones where every subsequent post would be progressively better than the ones before:

<b>09 May 2021</b> - [A/B Testing and Logistic Regressions](/html/entry10.html)

I applied my knowledge of basic statistics and hypothesis testing in a given case study, that is to understand if a new page yielded more favorable results than an old page.

<b>10 April 2021</b> - [EDA on the Gapminder dataset - exploring the total roads paved in a country](/html/entry9.html)

In this exercise, I learnt about numpy.where() as a faster method to return elements based on multiple conditions specified in a dataframe, as opposed to my go-to method of row by row looping. 

---

<b>13 March 2021</b> - [Sieve of Eratosthenes](/html/entry8.html)

Here, I attempt to define functions to get all prime numbers that are smaller than or equal to n. I found to be quite a challenging task.. but if anything, this exercise has cemented my practical understanding of the while loop.

<b>07 March 2021</b> - [A simple analysis of students' classroom grades](/html/entry7.html)

My first record of moving from R to Python! Here, I mostly utilise Pandas for my data analysis, playing with various data structures (dataframes, lists, dictionaries) for simple calculations. I also learnt something new here - the Collections module!

<b>29 Oct 2019</b> - [Predicting movie ratings on IMDb](/html/entry6.html)

In my third exercise, I use linear and multiple regression modelling to understand factors affecting movie ratings on IMDb. 

---

<b>15 Oct 2019</b> - [Statistical inference with the GSS data](/html/entry5.html)

In my second exercise of the Coursera course, I explore another dataset. Here, in addition to a mere descriptive analysis of the data, I also put into pratice what I learnt about statistical tests, such as the Chi-squared test.

<b>29 August 2019</b> - [Exploring the BRFSS dataset with descriptive analysis](/html/entry4.html)

I started taking online lessons on Coursera on [statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics), which required me to finish several peer-reviewed exercises. I will be documenting my homework here. In this first exercise, I explore a dataset with basic visualisation tools and descriptive summary statistics. 

<hr>

<b>01 July 2019</b> - [Cleaning data using stringr](/html/entry3.html)

My novice introduction to the term 'data wrangling' and 'regex', and the concept of defining functions to avoid repeating similar tasks when programming. 

---

<b>20 Jan 2019</b> - [Quantifying the relationship between global carbon dioxide emission and economic growth](/html/entry2.html)

Here, I calculate the strength of relationship between the aforementioned variables using Pearson's correlation test. I also put my basic understanding of correlations and p-values to the test. 

---

<b>24 Dec 2018</b> - [Visualising the relationship between global carbon dioxide emission and economic growth](/html/entry1.html)

My first very attempt in visualising an in-built dataset by the World Bank using the R plotly package!
